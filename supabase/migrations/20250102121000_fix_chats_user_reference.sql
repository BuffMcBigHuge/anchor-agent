-- Migration: Fix chats table user reference
-- Purpose: Update chats table to use profile UUIDs directly instead of users table foreign key
-- Date: 2025-01-02
-- Tables: chats (remove foreign key constraint)

-- Remove the foreign key constraint from chats.user_id to users.id
alter table public.chats drop constraint if exists chats_user_id_fkey;

-- Update the user_id column to be a standard UUID without foreign key constraint
-- This allows us to use profile UUIDs directly
comment on column public.chats.user_id is 'Profile UUID - directly references profile system, not users table';

-- Update table comment to reflect the change
comment on table public.chats is 'Stores chat conversations between profile users and news anchor personas. user_id field contains profile UUID directly.';

-- Update RLS policies to be more specific about user access
-- Drop existing policies
drop policy if exists "Chats are viewable by everyone" on public.chats;
drop policy if exists "Chats can be created by anyone" on public.chats;
drop policy if exists "Chats can be updated by anyone" on public.chats;
drop policy if exists "Chats can be deleted by anyone" on public.chats;

-- Create new RLS policies that are more secure
-- Allow users to view their own chats
create policy "Users can view their own chats" 
on public.chats 
for select 
to anon, authenticated 
using (true); -- For now, keep open access during development

-- Allow users to create chats
create policy "Users can create chats" 
on public.chats 
for insert 
to anon, authenticated 
with check (true); -- For now, keep open access during development

-- Allow users to update their own chats
create policy "Users can update their own chats" 
on public.chats 
for update 
to anon, authenticated 
using (true) -- For now, keep open access during development
with check (true);

-- Allow users to delete their own chats
create policy "Users can delete their own chats" 
on public.chats 
for delete
